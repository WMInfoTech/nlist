# nlist - experimental economics recruiting


###Setup
Upload the files to your server and navigate to the project's root directory. nlist will serve an install page, unless you've copied over a config file from a previous install. 

###Scheduling reminder emails
We'd rather not ask for access under the webroot, so you will need to manually add php/send_reminders.php as an hourly cron task. After that, you can opt to remind participants n hours before a session starts.
